        "review": "It is a largely recognized stereotype that women listen to girl in red when they are questioning/accepting their bi or lesbian sexuality. Many stereotypes are false but this is absolutely a foundational concept for queerness. My evidence is that when I was questioning my sexuality I would sit around all angsty and listen to girl in red ON REPEAT. It may be a little cringey but her lyrics perfectly encapsulated what was exploding around my head and all these feelings I was having when it was very confusing and raw. I remember listening to 'girls' and feeling almost at peace knowing that she understood how complicated it was having feelings for a girl -- especially when that girl was my best friend :0",

She has dealt with a lot of mental health and depression related to her gender and sexuality and I remember listening to her music and feeling so much. I think it is so important for her and other artists to have this platform to reach audiences of people like me who may be young and in the closet and need a role model. She is really relatable in real life and that is what makes her music so relatable, too, I think. In an interview she said (*pardon my french*) 'Art is just gay as fuck' and talked about growing up with queer art and how she wants to bring that to the next generation and I just really love every bit of her!",

Queer music doesn't always have to be emotional -- it can blow the roof off a joint! Through his music and visibility, he's become a voice for young LGBTQ+ individuals which is so important in normalizing queer experiences in mainstream media. One of my best friends from high school recently came out as gay and one of his icons is Troye Sivan because he is so unapologetic about his identity.",

I only knew one song when I saw her open for Leanna Firestone, but since then I actively follow her new music. I feel very safe playing her music when I have friends/family in the car because she sings about relationships without explicitly describing them as queer relationships. As another up and coming artist, I highly recommend listening to her music, and especially closeted queer people or queer people who are closeted in certain spaces (like their family or at work).",
