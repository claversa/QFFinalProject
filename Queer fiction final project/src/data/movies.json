        "review": "I watched Blue is the Warmest Color when I was questioning my sexuality and it was definitely relatable at least for me because I think that I did not have a day where I woke up and was like 'I like women', it was something that grew over time for a specific person. In the movie, the Adele meets Emma and that is the beginning of her sexual journey. Unfortunately, this movie is marred for me because of allegations of what happened on set and because it diverges so much from the book by eliminating any trace of the homophobia Adele faces after high school. The book shows her struggle with friends and society which leads to her drug addiction but the movie is an almost ideal world which I think was a great loss for the movie."

        "reviewer": "Caroline",
        "review": "Another movie on my journey of queerness! Truly a masterpiece! Fittingly, every frame feels like a painting and that Heloise is a muse in Marianne's painter eyes. I think this movie is so amazing because honestly almost nothing happens in the entire thing but you get this incredible vantage point to see how these two women interact and even just TALK to each other and it was very moving. and the love story is profoundly moving. I will never forget the Orpheus and Eurydice reference when they talk about how maybe Eurydice TOLD Orpheus to turn around even though it meant losing her forever and then at the end ... 'Turn around', breaks my heart."

        "genre": "Drama, LGBTQ+",
        "reviewer": "Caroline",
        "review": "I think Frankie's is a really important perspective because he is grappling with this internal homophobia and self-acceptance in the midst of a hyper-masculine environment. His friends are toxic, his family is not well off, his town is ultra conservative--there is little hope of a good reception for his coming out. I think that the very raw portrayal of Frankie navigating this unforgiving situation was super authentic and a pretty unique watch. I didn't connect as much with this movie but I guess it is because I am so fortunate that I live in a community and family that is so accepting."

His upbringing and environment of violence and poverty was such an interesting lens to see his sexual journey. Honestly just such a fresh and poetic approach to the typical story of self-acceptance and discovery."

        "review": "I can't count the number of times I have seen this movie. I had drawings of the cover hanging on my wall in high school and my best friend that I would watch it with has the cover art TATTOOED on her arm. Beautiful language to approach topics of identity and queerness.. 'Is it better to speak or to die'. I remember being obsessed with the characters' cat and mouse game, the beautiful setting (my friend actually went to the town in Crema where it was filmed after), the Sufjan Stephens music, everything. I watched a video where Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet were being interviewed about a scene where they are running up a rocky hillside and Chalamet says it looks so serene and beautiful but in real life they were getting stung by nettles and screaming and they could only have one take so Hammer is yelling at Chalamet to keep running. I just loved their chemistry and how authentic their friendship was and that translated into such a beautiful love story that was so relatable. I think it was especially relatable because my relationship with my ex-girlfriend started out as straight friends and like a 'will-we-wont-we' thing so that was really emotional to see on screen."

Such a beautiful, beautiful love story of men in the raw wilderness overcoming these toxically masculine expectations of society and just undergoing this super authentic and painful journey. I wish it didn't have to be so realistic and that the ending would have never happened but I can't wish for that in good faith because it is so important for people to feel that cutting pain and receive the message of the film."

        "review": "This is a really tough one. Devastatingly beautiful but I can only recommend with a grain of salt--you need to be very prepared for this movie. It follows the lives of 2 main characters who are shaped by childhood abuse and is a gut-wrenching testament to resilience. I remember one of my friends and I would watch movies over zoom together during COVID and as the credits rolled we looked at the computer screen and just saw each other red-faced, sopping wet crying. This movie is raw and doesn't hold back."

        "review": "I think this movie has everything. It has authentic characters that you can really rally behind and it makes the film so much more effective at delivering its message. It is like a sucker-punch. The vantage point of this pair fighting for their lives against AIDS is so important because seeing the crisis from the inside and from characters that an audience is connected with is such a powerful tool in uniting folks. I like to hope that films will have this role of uniting people when life is unforgiving and things are hopeless and unfair."

        "review": "I really liked this movie! I admittedly did not know much about NYC's drag ball scene before this, but it was heartwarming to know that even if we LGBT people are abandoned by society, we still have each other. And that's not nothing! I still see the impacts of this today in drag with drag families, and this gives a much better description of how instead of a social hierarchy its based on common location and support for the younger drag community, who often lose their own families when participating in drag."

        "review": "So relatable for queer people. Although it does not explicitly mention Owen's gender identity, I think his feelings are relatable for people in the queer community and in general anyone who feels like they have made a decision against their own desires for social pressure, like college students especially who face social pressure towards certain majors which make less money. I love indie films, and this was no exception. I loved how they played with lighting throughout the movie, getting less vibrant when the character was living against his truth. The soundtrack is incredible - I'm still listening to it weeks after finishing the movie. Plot is so haunting and sad."

Lavendar marriages are so valid, obviously in that time period where being gay was severely persecuted by the law but even today. I like that the movie mostly focuses on the cryptography and Turing's impact the most, because it makes the ending (and Turing's ending) even sadder. Love a sad movie, love the representation, no notes!"
